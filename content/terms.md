This is the website of the Open Music Europe Consortium (official EU grant abbreviation: OpenMusE). You can read more about the Consortium on the European Union’s official [CORDIS](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101095295) website—grant agreement ID: 101095295. You can find all the official information here.  You can read more about the Consortium partners in the [Consortium](https://openmuse.dataobservatory.eu/#consortium) menu.

Our Consortium follows the [Guidelines for Open Policy Analysis
](https://www.bitss.org/opa/community-standards/) and [FAIRification](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fairification-process/) best practices.  This means that all [Resources](https://openmuse.dataobservatory.eu/resources/), including their text and visual assets, even in manuscript form, hypotheses, and all documents are stored in the open GitHub repositories (with proper logging), and versions of deliverables are then sent to the Zenodo open science repository maintained by CERN and the OpenAIRE project of the European Union. In the `Deliverables`  menu, you will find a short overview and links to the deliverables.

The software deliverables can be found in the [Solutions/Software](https://openmuse.dataobservatory.eu/#releases) menu of this website, which directs you to the documentation of the software and the open GitHub repositories of the development version of the source code. The peer-reviewed and tested versions can be downloaded from CRAN. Their licensing policies can be found on the product pages.

The data deliverables can be downloaded via the [Data](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/pillar/music-economy/) menu in their current form and in periodic releases on Zenodo. Click through for their licensing policy. 

The website contents are created by the authors (researchers and support staff of the Consortium members) and [Synyo GmbH](https://openmuse.dataobservatory.eu/authors/synyo/) if not otherwise stated.  The photographs and still images are created by their authors, except for the logos of consortium members, and when not stated, they are created by Synyo.  

You can reuse all content, except for the logos and trademarks of the Consortium members, in a way that complies with the [Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/), and you do not make the impression that the content was created by you, or you represent the Consortium or its individual members. 

The website’s source code is stored in the [openmuse.dataobservatory.eu](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/openmuse.dataobservatory.eu) public GitHub repository. The static website (HTML, CSS, Javascript, and images) are created by [hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the world’s fastest framework for building websites, with the source code of the [wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) academic template, which in turn was modified by Daniel Antal and Reprex. It is open-source, and you can reuse it, but we strongly suggest that you donate to the free use of the source code because wowchemy maintains bug fixes and improvements from such donations. 

One copy of the website is hosted by [Sybell Informatika Kft](https://sybell.hu/) upon request from Reprex bv under the [openmuse.dataobservatory.eu](https://openmuse.dataobservatory.eu/) domain. This website uses Google Analytics to measure traffic.  Please, do not publish the website under a different domain because that would mislead users.
